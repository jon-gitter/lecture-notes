# Class 02 Lecture Notes

- Javascript is a loosly typed and dynamic language
  - dynamic means you can change the type of data after the variable has been declared
- constant variable will keep the variable constant and not dynamic
  - Ex `const dog = 'woof';` if you try to declare it later as `dog = 3;` you will get an error b/c const keeps the variable constant unlike using `let`


- always have 'use strict'; at the beginning of javascript code at line 1
  - forces me to use strict rules when writing javascript

- use the strict comparison operator over the loose inequalities
  - use `!==` instead of `!=`

- if you have multiple true statements then the if will only run the first true not both or the second.

- Logical operators
  - use the ! to make something not.  Ex: !isFalse would mean not false, therefore it would be true

- use "git add ." to add all files, you don't have to list all files
- best practice is to do small frequent ACPs
- git push origin branchname ----> for now do git push origin main, this will push to my main branch (only branch i have right now anyways, if you only do git push it will default to pushing to your main branch so use with caution)


INSIDE `<head>`
- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/reset.css">`
- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">`

INSIDE `<body>`
 - `<script src= >`


 `let answerOne = prompt('Do I have a daughter?').toLowerCase();`

```
if(answerOne === 'yes' || answerOne === 'y'){
  alert('Yes I do have a daughter!');
} else if(answerOne === 'no' || answerOne === 'n'){
  alert('Sorry you are incorrect');
}
```
