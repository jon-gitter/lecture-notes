# Class 05 notes

- use unspalsh.com for free images

- put image inside `<body>` and then `<figure>` elements then `<figcaption>` image will go below `</figcaption>`
  - ex:   `<figure>`
          `<figcaption>``</figcaption>` 
          `<img src ="" alt="" title=""/>` src and alt are required, title="" is optional but good practice
          `</figure>`

- for images need to have src and alt within `<img>` element.  Helpful for those using a screen reader

## CSS 

- `*` will select all elements

- can set width: max-content; to get content to fit within the box you set
  - or you can do a `img {width: 100%;}` to set the image width inside the box its in
 
 - width with % is better for scaling of browser size, makes it more responsive. Pixels are not recommended b/c they don't scale as well as %
 
 - can use media queries to tell css to set different styling based on the device the user is using

 - use :inherit to inherit properties from its top most parent

 - use `cssfontstack.com` to get font styling ideas or `googlefonts` will include links for html and css
