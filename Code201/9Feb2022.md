## Arrays

- data type and data structure (typeof arrray) -> object, a special type of object
- a collection or a list of elements - can be mixed
  - strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects
- In JS we don't have to predetermine the size of the array
- every element in the array has an index (location reference) that we can use to find where it is in the array.
  - JS arrays are a zero based index system (starts at 0 then goes up, does not start at 1)

- Built in methods
  - methods `.name()`
  - `.push()`, `.pop()`
  - use MDN and look up array methods js through google
- property
  - `.length`
- property vs method one has () to other does not

### Array Examples

let `myArr = [1, 2, 3, [1, 2, 5], 4, 5, 'hello'];`
`console.table(myArr);`  -> very helpful to see a better description of what's going on than plain `console.log(myArr);`

      indexes ->   0         1          2            3
`let students = ['Cole', 'Dwight', 'Christopher', 'Abdi'];`
`let dwight = students[1];`
`console.log(dwight);` -> this will display Dwight

`let valTwo = myArr[3][1];` -> this will pull index 3's (which has its own array) index 1

`console.log(students.length);` -> this will show you how long the array is aka how many elements are in there, correct answer will be 4 b/c it starts at 0.

`students[4]= 'Bishal';` -> adding Bishal to array
`console.log(students);` -> this will add another student to the array, if you add a number larger than what is current or subsequent you will get undefined in each index until you hit your number.
`students[0]= 'Tanesha';` -> this will reasign a new value to what was previous

// Using the `.push()` method //

`students.push('Steve');`  -> common way to add elements to the end of an array
`students.unshift('Ella');` -> common way to add elements to the beginning of an array
`students.splice(3, 0, 'Ryan');`  -> add to a specific location in an array. order = what index to start, # of items to remove (if you insert 0 it won't remove anything), what to add (if any)


## Loops

 - good for iterating over/through arrays
 
 FOR LOOPS

 - anatomy of a for loop
  - `for(starting value; condition; increment){
    code block -- do something each iteration
  }`

Example:
  `let students = ['Cole', 'Dwight', 'Christopher', 'Abdi'];`
  `for(let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
      console.log('Hey! ${students[i]}!');
      if(students[i] === 'Christopher'){
        console.log('Hey whats up Christopher!'); --> finding something specific in an array nested inside a for loop
      }
  }`

  // 1st iteration: i = 0, i < 4 (true);
  // console.log('Hey! ${students[0]}!');
  // i gets incremented
  // 2nd iteration: i = 1, i < 4 (true);
  // console.log('Hey! ${students[1]}!');
  // i gets incremented


WHILE LOOPS
- **great for doing something however many times you need until a condition goes false**
- anatomy of a while loop
  - `while(condition){
      do something until the condition is false
  }

  Example:

  `let myNumber = 4;`
  `let userNumber = prompt('What number am I thinking of?');`

  `while(userNumber != myNumber){
    userNumber = prompt('What number am I thinking of?');
    if(userNumber == myNumber){
      alert('you are correct!');
    }
  }`
