## what is react?
- a JS library for building UI components
- UI components = the space where interaction between humans and machines occur
- used to organize projects in terms of pages home -> about -> store, need to think smaller think about individual components
- instead of repeating ourselves in our HTML we could use JS to build these components with different content, thats where react comes in
- will use node package manager in our terminal to generate our react application
  - command in terminal = npx create-react-app name-of-my-app (written in kabab case)
  - look at 11:32am for direction
  

- type npm start to open up live server from console
  - use ctrl + c to end the server

- deployment
  - saying is "deploy early"
  - 11:41am 
  - set up github first
    - create repo, public, DO NOT check readmefile/add.gitignore/choose a license (skipped b/c react gives us this out of the box)
    - use the "push an existing repo from the command line" instructions
  - use site netlify.com
    - login
    - add a new site
    - import existing project
    - connect from github
    - search for repo, if not found click "configure netlify app"
    - scroll to repo access, select repo you want
    - save
    - should now have the ability to select
    - can choose default settings
    - select deploy (takes a few minutes)
    - click on deployed site


- do not need app.test.js, logo.svg, reportWebVitals, one more!!!
  - need to delete the corresponding files in app.js, etc.


- App.js is uppercase
  - uppercase indicates it's a react component
    - functional components - used in 401
    - class components
      - start by importing from react `import React from 'react';`
        ```
        import React from 'react';
        import Header from './Header.js';
        // to get css in react
        import './App.css';

        class App extends React.Component {
          render(){
            // use () to trick react to executing code and make it more readable
            // can use <></> (fractional elements) to have multiple elements to include <main>, <footer>, etc
            return (
              <>
              <Header/>
              <h1>People of 301d83</h1>
              </Header>
              <main>
                <article>
                  <h3>Sheyna</h3>
                  <p>maybe some text goes here</p>
              </main>
              <footer>
                &copy; Code Fellows, 2022
              </footer>
              </>
            );
          }
        }

        export default App;
        ```


- create a new Header.js in src

```
import React from 'react';

class Header extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <header>
        <h1>People of 301d83</h1>
        <p> text here</p>

    )
  }
}
```






## Props in React 
- can create multiple instances of the same component, but give each different content by sending them different data through props
- props = data passed from parent to child. a child cannot change the props passed to it
- example:
```
<main>
  <Person name="Sheyna"/>
  <Person name="Cole"/>
  <Person name="Nathan"/>
